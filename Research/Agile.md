## Introduction

There is more than one way to work as a group on a large project.
There is no correct answer to which method is the best, it is all based on personal preference, even so there are certain pro's and cons to certain methods.
But the overall idea of agile is a flexible work method.

## The Finland project

Our group project was in cooperation with a group of Finnish students.
3 members of our group went to Finland in February to establish a connection with the other students and think of a project that we could work on for the coming months.
In may those same Finnish students came to the Netherlands to finish the project.

## Agile

Agile is a method of working on a project, in iterative steps. It is mostly used by software development teams.
It focuses on being flexible. And it is usually split into 5 parts.

### Requirements
First of all you start with the requirements. 
What should it be able to do, and what do you need to be able to make this.
Normally the stakeholders come up with requirements (sometimes in collaboration with the developers).

### Planning
Then you can make a planning. You devide the requirements in tasks which you can then assign to people with a certain timeframe. To keep track of all the tasks you can use tools like [Taiga]([https://www.taiga.io/](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jeffrey_derksen-international-project/backlog)).

### Collaborative Design
After this the planning you can design the software. Think of how you are going to accomplish your tasks and what you will need.

### Create and implement
When all of this is done you can start on actually creating the product. Try to finish all tasks assigned to you. If you are done with all your tasks you can always help another member who hasn't. Or (this is not recommended) assign a new task to yourself.

### Review
And finaly you have a retrospective, a review on how everything went. You can give each other tips and say what you thought should go better next time.
Then the cycle starts again (usually with the planning). This cycle can take however long you want but most teams take 3 to 4 weeks per cycle. This way they make sure they dont get too large a task, and keep the progression to a maximum.

## [Scrum](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-scrum)

We decided to use the Scrum method because it is extremely versatile. It allows you to change your goals on a day to day or week to week basis. This makes task way easier to oversee and get done. It also provides a more joyous work experience since you get a task done basically every day which is very satisfying.
It was perfect for this project since at the beginning we didn't have a clear idea of what the project was going to be or how far we would get. With the help of scrum we were able to easily alter the tasks and goals, to be more accurate with what we would actually be able to accomplish.
We didn't have set roles for all sprints, we changed roles each sprint because this was the best way for us to learn how to use scrum.
We used [Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/jeffrey_derksen-international-project/backlog) as our scrum tool, held weekly meetings and invited all stakeholders to the sprint delivery.

### Roles:

##### Product owner

The product owner is in close contact with the person or company giving the assignment
He makes most of the decisions and can add items to the backlog if the stakeholders requests them.

#### Scrum master

He is basically the groups coach, He oversees the project and tries to get the team to function optimally .

#### Developer / team member

They are the people that create most of the assignment.
This is the remainder of the developers, they code under the "Supervision" of the scrum master and try to get as much of the requirements done in time.

### What do you need

First of all you create a product backlog, this contains all the items that you are planning on making divided in small tasks which you can finish in about a day.

Then you need a sprint backlog, a sprint is 2 to 4 weeks depending on the size of the project, in which you try to finish a certain part of the assignment.

The sprint backlog is similar to the product backlog but it only has all the tasks that you are planning to do in that sprint.

You also need acceptation criteria, these are predetermined criteria of when you consider a task to be complete. These are decided by the group at the beginning and make sure that when you finish a task everybody is satisfied and it doesnâ€™t need changing.

And last but not least you need a scrum board, A place that shows all the tasks and in what stage of completion they are.
This board is divided in sprints as well and you can assign a task to someone who will then be responsible for that part of the project.

## [Kanban](https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-kanban-board)

![Kanban](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73878099/175043438-41888d6a-3073-4efc-8d1e-982191403501.png)

Kanban is in my opinion a simpler version of scrum. You have a Kanban Board, which has all the tasks devided in 3 sections.
And they are (in my opinion) very self explanatory.
#### To Do
In this section you put all the tasks that you still need to do to finish all the requirements. It is like a backlog of all tasks.
#### Doing
In this section you put all the tasks that you are currently working on. All tasks in this section are in progress, which there are normally not that many.
#### Done
And finaly you have the section "Done". In this section you can see all tasks that have been finished. This way everybody can see how far you are along with the project.

This is the main principle of Kanban. I personaly really like Kanban since it is not that complicated but works nontheless.
This is why I used it for my individual project.

I added a "To verify" section, in this I put everything that I think is done but needs to be verified by the stakeholders.

kanban works better for really small groups or individual people. Because if you have a lot of people working on a lot of different tasks the board gets really cluttered really fast. This is why for our group project we used [scrum](https://github.com/StokersWebsite/.github/edit/main/Research/Agile.md#scrum) and for my individual project I used Kanban.
