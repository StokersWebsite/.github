A business process is a structured and measurable set of activities that are designed for a specific output.
A company can have lots of different business process. And they all take care of a different specific thing in the companry.
It can include: identifying, designing, implementing automated processes and performing actions.

## Business process management
Business process managements or BPM for short, aims to improve the business processes.
This includes everything in a process, from identifying to implementation.
The main benefits of having proper BPM are:

### Increased productivity
BMP helps to create a solid framework to manage the organizations processes.
It can document, monitor and optimize processes.
Useless processes are easily identified and can be removed.

### Agility
If your organization has a properly set up BPM processes can be easily modified and updated, without causing to much of a change.
If you know a process very well and know how they work (due to proper BPM) changes can be easily explained and understood.

### Less errors
With original tools there is almost no way to keep everything updated and know what does what.
This results in less errors, and with a BPM errors are also easilier tracked.
