## What is a business process?
A business process is a structured and measurable set of activities that are designed for a specific output.
A company can have lots of different business process. And they all take care of a different specific thing in the companry.
It can include: identifying, designing, implementing automated processes and performing actions.

## BPMN
BPMN stands for Business Process Modeling notation and it is used for and its a modeling language for business processes. It is very easy to understand and thus can be use by all stakeholders. 
It is useful :
- Provides businesses with the capability of defining and understanding their procedures through Business Process Diagrams
- To provide a standard notation that is readily understandable by all business stakeholders
- To bridge the communication gap that frequently occurs between business process design and implementation
- Simple to learn yet powerful enough to depict the potential complexities of a business process

## Business process management
Business process managements or BPM for short, aims to improve the business processes.
This includes everything in a process, from identifying to implementation.
The main benefits of having proper BPM are:

### Increased productivity
BMP helps to create a solid framework to manage the organizations processes.
It can document, monitor and optimize processes.
Useless processes are easily identified and can be removed.

### Agility
If your organization has a properly set up BPM processes can be easily modified and updated, without causing to much of a change.
If you know a process very well and know how they work (due to proper BPM) changes can be easily explained and understood.

### Less errors
With original tools there is almost no way to keep everything updated and know what does what.
This results in less errors, and with a BPM errors are also easilier tracked.

### Reduce the need for a lot of management
Whenworking on a project with a group of people there is likely to be someone who doesn't stick to the predetermined methods. When this is clearly established with a proper BPM everybody is always on the same page.

### Stokers business Process
For my own business process I chose the add activity option for the stokers website. 
Currently (without my software intergration) whenever you want to arrange an activity you sent a message in the group chat with all the stoker embers. However, this is chaotic and doesn't really work since a lot of people can then respond on your proposition. Which leads to less people reading the chat. Also, a lot of people may originaly think "what a great idea" and respond with that. But hen realise that they can't attend it that day. It is also hard to remember what activities are planned when, and to which activities you said yes.
This process has already been improved, now you can send a mail to the board of the stokers who then decide if it is a good idea. And if it is they can send it in the announcement chat. In a business process this looks like this:

With the website the business process looks like this:

In the end you get your activity on the website on which other stokers members can join it.
This is very useful since then you can also see how many people want to attend the activity. Plus members can see when all activities are going to take place.
