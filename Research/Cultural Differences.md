## What is culture?
The definition of culture is:
The characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.
![Culture](https://www.erasmus-journal.eu/wp-content/uploads/48331673207_9a29bfdd53_o-1024x515.png)
There are tons of diferent cultures, and lots of them also differ in software development.

### Software
The main one being if a country is high or low context.
"Low-context cultures follow a more logical decision-making style, encourage and obey written commitments, have individualistic working styles, and do not typically encourage personal relationships formed in a work environment." 
Countries like England and the US fall under this category.

"On the other hand, high-context countries have a more intuitive decision-making style, place more value on oral agreements, have team-oriented working styles, and usually encourage personal relationships being formed in a work environment. These relationships have the power to influence business decisions." 
Countries like China and India fall into this category. 

### When working with a developer from another culture you should should consider where he or she falls on these scales:
#### - Communicating: explicit vs. implicit

#### - Evaluating: direct negative feedback vs. indirect negative feedback

#### - Persuading: deductive vs. inductive

#### - Leading: egalitarian vs. hierarchical

#### - Deciding: consensual vs. top down

#### - Trusting: task vs. relationship

#### - Disagreeing: confrontational vs. avoid confrontation

#### - Scheduling: structured vs. flexible

When done correctly you know how to work together the best way possible.

## Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences? 
According to [Hofstede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory#:~:text=The%20original%20theory%20proposed%20four,orientation%20versus%20person%2Dorientation) there are 4 cultural dimensions:
- individualism-collectivism; 
- uncertainty avoidance; 
- power distance (strength of social hierarchy) 
- masculinity-femininity 

This is based on national rather than individual preferences
And this can help with inter cultural communication. 
With Eeventify however we didn's use all of this and we could still manage to have a good relation with the Finnish students, even though they have a different culture.

## What is my culture
We in the Netherlands are generally quite individually focused.

## Cultural restrictions
There is a lot of differnce in cultures in what is allowed. For example China has a really stict policy on what software and even hardware is allowed.
In China apps like Tik Tok are banned which defeats the purpose of ["Software should be available everywhere](https://github.com/StokersWebsite/.github/blob/main/Research/Ethics.md#web-applications-should-work-everywhere).
Which is a part of my personal research on ethics in software.
These things are very different per culture, but they don't really affect the developer itself.
Another example is loot boxes. In some countries they are banned while in others they are not. This however can affect the developer (of a game) since he is then not allowed to "sell" his software in certain countries unless he removes the loot boxes. If you want to know more about this controversy you should check out [Loot Box ethics research](https://github.com/StokersWebsite/.github/edit/main/Research/Ethics.md#loot-boxes).

## Eeventify
My personal experience mostly comes from the [Eeventify](https://github.com/Eeventify) project. This is a project we did this semester together with a group of students from Finland. In Febuary (2022) [Tjerk](https://github.com/TjerkZ), [Timo](https://github.com/timojw) and me went to the [Oulu university of applied sciences](https://www.oamk.fi/en/). While we were there we came up with a project we could work on during our semester. Throughout the semester we came across a lot of cultural differences that we had to overcome to get a finished product by the end of the semester.

For example the communication, We as Dutch students knew exactly what each of us was doing every day we worked on the project. In Finland however it seemed like they were all building a different application. But when things had to be discussed between Dutch and Finnish students this always happened correctly and efficiently.
So eventually even we (as dutch students) knew what each Finnish student was doing during a sprint.

We all learned a lot about working with developers from a different culture. And when given the opportunity I would deffinitly want to work with other cultures.
Yes it does create another challange but I thought it was fun and educational to overcome this.
