## What is culture?
[The definition of culture](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/culture) is:
The characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.
![Culture](https://www.erasmus-journal.eu/wp-content/uploads/48331673207_9a29bfdd53_o-1024x515.png)
There are tons of different cultures, and lots of them also differ in software development.

### Software
[The main one being if a country is high or low context.](https://www.businessinsider.com/the-culture-map-8-scales-for-work-2015-1?international=true&r=US&IR=T)
"Low-context cultures follow a more logical decision-making style, encourage and obey written commitments, have individualistic working styles, and do not typically encourage personal relationships formed in a work environment." Countries like England and the US fall under this category.

"On the other hand, high-context countries have a more intuitive decision-making style, place more value on oral agreements, have team-oriented working styles, and usually encourage personal relationships being formed in a work environment. These relationships have the power to influence business decisions." 
Countries like China and India fall into this category. 

### When working with a developer from another culture you should consider where he or she falls on these scales:
#### - Communicating: explicit vs. implicit
![Communication](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73878099/174999286-d349fa0c-b672-4d06-8531-11140079a084.png)
#### - Evaluating: direct negative feedback vs. indirect negative feedback

#### - Persuading: deductive vs. inductive

#### - Leading: egalitarian vs. hierarchical

#### - Deciding: consensual vs. top down

#### - Trusting: task vs. relationship
![Trusting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73878099/174999921-4870292d-245d-402e-ba66-49cbbfc87510.png)
#### - Disagreeing: confrontational vs. avoid confrontation
![Disagreeing](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73878099/174999944-2569c861-77d1-4320-9d5d-6f2a1011c46f.png)
#### - Scheduling: structured vs. flexible

When done correctly you know how to work together the best way possible.

## Which are well-known dimensions on cultural differences? 
According to the original theory of [Hofstede](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimensions_theory#:~:text=The%20original%20theory%20proposed%20four,orientation%20versus%20person%2Dorientation) there are 4 cultural dimensions:
- individualism-collectivism; 
- uncertainty avoidance; 
- power distance (strength of social hierarchy) 
- masculinity-femininity 

Later the theory was improved and now it has 6.
![Hofstede](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73878099/175284848-95c1e19d-b7e8-4bc7-b522-e033220b19e0.png)

This is based on national rather than individual preferences
And this can help with inter cultural communication. 
With Eeventify however we didn's use all of this and we could still manage to have a good relation with the Finnish students, even though they have a different culture.

## Cultural restrictions
There is a lot of difference in cultures in what is allowed. For example China has a really strict policy on what software and even hardware is allowed.
In [China apps like Tik Tok are banned](https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/09/china-moves-to-ban-foreign-software-and-hardware-from-state-offices/) which defeats the purpose of ["Software should be available everywhere](https://github.com/StokersWebsite/.github/blob/main/Research/Ethics.md#web-applications-should-work-everywhere).
Which is a part of my personal research on ethics in software.
These things are very different per culture, but they don't really affect the developer itself.
Another example is loot boxes. In some countries they are banned while in others they are not. This however can affect the developer (of a game) since he is then not allowed to "sell" his software in certain countries unless he removes the loot boxes. If you want to know more about this controversy you should check out [Loot Box ethics research](https://github.com/StokersWebsite/.github/edit/main/Research/Ethics.md#loot-boxes).

## Personal Experience
![Dutch/FinnishFlag](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73878099/175038299-78026856-892c-491b-9f5a-6bd1dda4e677.png)

My personal experience mostly comes from the [Eeventify](https://github.com/Eeventify) project. This is a project we did this semester together with a group of students from Finland. In Febuary (2022) [Tjerk](https://github.com/TjerkZ), [Timo](https://github.com/timojw) and me went to the [Oulu university of applied sciences](https://www.oamk.fi/en/). While we were there we came up with a project we could work on during our semester. Throughout the semester we came across a lot of cultural differences that we had to overcome to get a finished product by the end of the semester.

For example the communication, We as Finnish students knew exactly what each of us was doing every day we worked on the project. Here however it seemed like we were all building a different application. But when things had to be discussed between Dutch and Finnish students this always happened correctly and efficiently.
So eventually even the Finnish student knew what we were doing during a sprint. This alligns with the 2nd dimension [Individualism Versus Collectivism](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_66.htm#:~:text=2.%20Individualism%20Versus%20Collectivism%20(IDV)), since all the Dutch students were very individual while the Finnish students were very collective.

The Finnish students were generally very cooperative, and quick to compromise. If we ever had a disagreement on what something should be we could therefore easily find a compromise. 

We all learned a lot about working with developers from a different culture. And when given the opportunity I would definitely want to work with other cultures.
Yes it does create another challange but I thought it was fun and educational to overcome this.
