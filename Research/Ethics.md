### Introduction  
As in most things ethics also apply when creating software. You may think ethics arent a big  deal in software development, but you would be mistaken.
There are a lot of choises when developing software based on ethical and moral choises.

### What are ethics?

#### General Ethics
The definition is: "ethics, also called moral philosophy, the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad and morally right and wrong. The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles." 
But ofcourse the idea of ethics differs from the ethics code in software development.

#### Software Ethics

### Why are ethics such an important part of software development?
When you create a piece of software and it becomes popular you have the possibilty to abuse this. This woulnd be that hard to do and could earn you a lot more money. So a lot of software engineers will probably be tempted. And when not corrected by a moral compass he or she can have a large impact on a lot of peoples lives.

### How could you abuse software 
There are lots of ways to abuse software development.
First and foremost you can sell a users private information.
For most applications you will need to create a account, to get this account you will most likely need to fill in some or a lot of personal information depending on the application.
If the software developer is willing to he or she can sell this information to someone who will then abuse it.  

you could also add something in small text at the bottom of a users agreement, Most users wont read that anyways and without a moral compass you can easily have a user agree to something that he or she doesnt want.

But the most problematic for most people is the financial side of it all. If you need to pay for the application the user fills out his or her bank information , this in of itself is problematic if the application gets hacked and the information is leaked. But that is something further explained in the security analysis since it has to do with the security of the application rather than the ethics of software. 

Furthermore if the software engineer adds a monthly payment instead of a yearly payment and users can lose a lot of money through software.

Another possiblility is to make the design of your software as addictive as possible.
If you make a design addictive it may be good for you but most likely not for the user.

### The software users
There is another problem with software ethics, the users.
If a software engineer creates a social application this is not a ethical problem in and of itself. But a user can use the application to bully or discriminate another user which is not ethical and uses software but not by deffinition the fault of the software engineer.
