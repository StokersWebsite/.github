### Introduction  
As in most things ethics also apply when creating software. You may think ethics arent a big  deal in software development, but you would be mistaken.
There are a lot of choises when developing software based on ethical and moral choises.

### What are ethics?
The definition is: "ethics, also called moral philosophy, the discipline concerned with what is morally good and bad and morally right and wrong. The term is also applied to any system or theory of moral values or principles." 
But ofcourse the idea of ethics differs from the ethics code in software development.

### Ethics in software
There are 4 main principles of ethical web development that every developer should strive to stick to.

#### web applications should work for everyone
A developer should prioratize accessibility so you dont exclude anyone. This also means he should test with real users on all kind of platforms.

#### Web applications should work everywhere
When creating an application you should always ofcourse value performance. But this also has an impact on its ethical aspects, since this allows everybody to acces your application from pretty much everywhere.

#### web applications should respect a user's privacy and security
Probably the most important aspect of ethics in software according to most users is Privacy and security.
This is because if your websites security isnt sufficient people personal information can be leaked.
This is why you should use https everywehre, secure user data, provide users with clear information about how their information is used and allow users to export their data.
As of for how your website deals with privacy, you should always respect the users preferences.

#### web developers should be considerate of their peers
One does this by:
- Commenting and documenting code
- properly test code
- use CI and source control
- try to make everything open source
- treat other developers with respect
- follow the code of conduct

### Why are ethics such an important part of software development?
When you create a piece of software and it becomes popular you have the possibilty to abuse this. This woulnd be that hard to do and could earn you a lot more money. So a lot of software engineers will probably be tempted. And when not corrected by a moral compass he or she can have a large impact on a lot of peoples lives.

### How could you abuse software 
There are lots of ways to abuse software development.
First and foremost you can sell a users private information.
For most applications you will need to create a account, to get this account you will most likely need to fill in some or a lot of personal information depending on the application.
If the software developer is willing to he or she can sell this information to someone who will then abuse it.  

you could also add something in small text at the bottom of a users agreement, Most users wont read that anyways and without a moral compass you can easily have a user agree to something that he or she doesnt want.

But the most problematic for most people is the financial side of it all. If you need to pay for the application the user fills out his or her bank information , this in of itself is problematic if the application gets hacked and the information is leaked. But that is something further explained in the security analysis since it has to do with the security of the application rather than the ethics of software. 

Furthermore if the software engineer adds a monthly payment instead of a yearly payment and users can lose a lot of money through software.

Another possiblility is to make the design of your software as addictive as possible.
If you make a design addictive it may be good for you but most likely not for the user.

### The software users
There is another problem with software ethics, the users.
If a software engineer creates a social application this is not a ethical problem in and of itself. But a user can use the application to bully or discriminate another user which is not ethical and uses software but not by deffinition the fault of the software engineer.

### Adverts
When you create a application or website it is very tempting to allow ads so you can make money off of it. there are however also unethical aspects to this.
Advertisements are considered unethical when they:
- It gives false information.
- It degrades the rivalâ€™s product or substitute product.
- It makes exaggerated or tall claims.
- It is against the national and public interest.
- It gives misguiding information,
- It conceals information that vitally affects human life.
- It is obscene or immoral.

Plus you can have your entire website or application be full of ads, which makes it almost un-usable:

Whether you find this unethical is an oppinion though.

### Loot Boxes
Another aspect of ethics related to software is gambling.
To promote gambling can be considered unehtical since it can destroy lives. 
To make it appealing for kids even worse. 
A lot of games create loot boxes, these are boxes bought with real money, but you don't know what is in them.
What is in them can be worthless or extremely valuable, Also known as gambling.

This has recently been banned in countries like belgium, but it is still legal in the Netherlands.
