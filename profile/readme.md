## Introduction
>This project is a website for the carnaval's organisation "De Stokers".
>It is meant to attract more members to the organisation and to plan and see all upcoming activities that they are going to partake in. Plus you can see pictures and videos of previous activities and specials like the "Mooi man" cover and a caranval press conference.

## Project Setup
>The project uses a react frontend and a asp.net API that manages the activities.
>Furthermore it uses the instagram and YouTube API to show the stokers instagram feed and its YouTube specials.

## Full stack
"You design and build **user-friendly**, **full-stack** web applications."

For my website I designed a frontend that looks like this:

Furthermore it can show you all the upcomming activities:

You can also see the stokers specials on the website:

I made this using React JS because I had never used Javascript and I would love to learn it since it is growing in popularity and it seemed to be handy in the future.
